      Welcome to the homepage of the Willamette Student Security club! We are a collection of students with an interest in the field of cybersecurity. We compete in a bianual competition, called the National Cyber League,  where we can showcase our skills in categories such as cryptography and web application exploitation. If you want to learn more, drop by our discord server and come to one of our meetings! That is, if you can find the invite link.

      Speaking of cryptography, did you know that there are some ancient codes still used today? One of Julius Ceasar's many accomplishments was the Ceasar cypher, which is still in use today. Many variations have appeared on this encryption pattern, including the ever popular ROT-13 cypher. This is a pretty simple encryption, but you would be surprised how many people still use it.
