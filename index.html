    Welcome to the homepage of the Willamette Student Security club! We are a collection of students with an interest in the field of cybersecurity. We compete in a bianual competition, called the National Cyber League,  where we can showcase our skills in categories such as cryptography and web application exploitation. If you want to learn more, drop by our discord server and come to one of our meetings! That is, if you can find the invite link.

    Speaking of cryptography, did you know that there are some ancient codes still used today? One of Julius Ceasar's many accomplishments was the Ceasar cypher, which is still in use today. Many variations have appeared on this encryption pattern, including the ever popular ROT-13 cypher. This is a pretty simple encryption, but you would be surprised how many people still use it.

	<p>We are excited to announce that Lapka has been acquired by <a href="http://airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. So excited, in fact, that it’ll be hard to sum up our feelings just yet. But we’ll try.</p>

	<p>Lapka started with the ambitious idea to build the most beautiful science ever. We first set out to explore <a href="/bam">body network</a> and <a href="/pem">personal environment</a>, utilizing numerous, sensitive environmental factors such as <a href="/pem#radiation">radiation</a> and carbon monoxide. We built tools for self-care and mind harmony, but never saw them as medicinal devices.</p>

	<p>Technology is powered by style, taste and story. Not by technology alone. Whether it was a  radiation sensor, EMF sensor or even a breathalyzer, each product was imagined as a token, charm or talisman, not a device.</p>

	<p>At Lapka, we were unconcerned with investing in a particular device, service, category or direction. Instead, we focused on creating an adaptable lifestyle brand where people can engage comfortably and enthusiastically. People only resort to a glucose monitor company when they need to. We imagined a teenage girl needing a glucose monitor, but afraid to use one because of its experience. We thought, what if we could redesign the whole experience — how you get the monitor, how you found out about it, how its story is told. We realized it should be about anything but glucose and medicine. That's the vision that was set and executed for all our products.</p>

	<p>Lapka was a lifestyle brand. We never intended to build “medical devices”. Instead, think of Lapka as a magazine, a coffee shop, a funny Twitter account, a movie. So if all you have is $2.95 for an iced coffee, you can still engage with Lapka.</p>

	<p>I am super excited for Lapka to join Airbnb. Both companies share an extreme passion for design, beauty and meaningful, cinematic experiences. What we’re capable of building together is beyond explanation, so let’s leave that for later news. The future is long.</p>

	<p>After 100,000+ measurements from over <a href="http://map.mylapka.com" target="_blank">76 countries</a>, we are discontinuing Lapka’s operations. We will not be manufacturing or developing any new products. However, we are still providing full support for our existing customers. As always, feel free to reach us at <a href="mailto:support@mylapka.com">support@mylapka.com</a></p>

	<p>We are excited to announce that Lapka has been acquired by <a href="http://airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. So excited, in fact, that it’ll be hard to sum up our feelings just yet. But we’ll try.</p>

	<p>Lapka started with the ambitious idea to build the most beautiful science ever. We first set out to explore <a href="/bam">body network</a> and <a href="/pem">personal environment</a>, utilizing numerous, sensitive environmental factors such as <a href="/pem#radiation">radiation</a> and carbon monoxide. We built tools for self-care and mind harmony, but never saw them as medicinal devices.</p>

	<p>Technology is powered by style, taste and story. Not by technology alone. Whether it was a  radiation sensor, EMF sensor or even a breathalyzer, each product was imagined as a token, charm or talisman, not a device.</p>

	<p>At Lapka, we were unconcerned with investing in a particular device, service, category or direction. Instead, we focused on creating an adaptable lifestyle brand where people can engage comfortably and enthusiastically. People only resort to a glucose monitor company when they need to. We imagined a teenage girl needing a glucose monitor, but afraid to use one because of its experience. We thought, what if we could redesign the whole experience — how you get the monitor, how you found out about it, how its story is told. We realized it should be about anything but glucose and medicine. That's the vision that was set and executed for all our products.</p>

	<p>Lapka was a lifestyle brand. We never intended to build “medical devices”. Instead, think of Lapka as a magazine, a coffee shop, a funny Twitter account, a movie. So if all you have is $2.95 for an iced coffee, you can still engage with Lapka.</p>

	<p>I am super excited for Lapka to join Airbnb. Both companies share an extreme passion for design, beauty and meaningful, cinematic experiences. What we’re capable of building together is beyond explanation, so let’s leave that for later news. The future is long.</p>

	<p>After 100,000+ measurements from over <a href="http://map.mylapka.com" target="_blank">76 countries</a>, we are discontinuing Lapka’s operations. We will not be manufacturing or developing any new products. However, we are still providing full support for our existing customers. As always, feel free to reach us at <a href="mailto:support@mylapka.com">support@mylapka.com</a></p>

    Welcome to the homepage of the Willamette Student Security club! We are a collection of students with an interest in the field of cybersecurity. We compete in a bianual competition, called the National Cyber League,  where we can showcase our skills in categories such as cryptography and web application exploitation. If you want to learn more, drop by our discord server and come to one of our meetings! That is, if you can find the invite link.

    Speaking of cryptography, did you know that there are some ancient codes still used today? One of Julius Ceasar's many accomplishments was the Ceasar cypher, which is still in use today. Many variations have appeared on this encryption pattern, including the ever popular ROT-13 cypher. This is a pretty simple encryption, but you would be surprised how many people still use it.
